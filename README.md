# Flappy Bird Game in Java

This is a simple implementation of the Flappy Bird game using Java and Swing. The game involves controlling a bird to navigate through a series of pipes without colliding with them.

## Features
- Basic game mechanics similar to the original Flappy Bird game.
- Real-time collision detection.
- Score tracking.
- Game restart functionality.

## Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flappy-bird-java.git
   cd flappy-bird-java
   ```

2. **Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.**

3. **Add the required images:**
   Place the following images in the `resources` directory of your project:
   - `flappybirdbg.png` (Background image)
   - `flappybird.png` (Bird image)
   - `toppipe.png` (Top pipe image)
   - `bottompipe.png` (Bottom pipe image)

4. **Compile and run the project:**
   Ensure that your project structure allows you to run the `FlappyBird` class as a Java application.

## Game Controls
- **Spacebar**: Make the bird jump.
- **Restart**: When the game is over, press the spacebar to restart the game.

## Code Structure
- **FlappyBird.java**: Main game logic and rendering.
- **Bird class**: Represents the bird in the game.
- **Pipe class**: Represents the pipes in the game.

## How to Play
1. Run the `FlappyBird` application.
2. Press the spacebar to make the bird jump.
3. Navigate through the pipes without hitting them.
4. Keep track of your score displayed on the top left of the screen.
5. If the bird hits a pipe or the ground, the game is over. Press the spacebar to restart the game.
